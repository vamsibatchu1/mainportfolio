# Old Home Components

This directory contains the components and files from the previous `/home` route, which has been replaced by the new `/home` route as the default landing page.

These files are kept for reference and experimental purposes. The main site now uses the components from the new `/home` directory for the landing page experience.

## Files included:

- `current.tsx`: The main content component for the old home page
- `page.tsx`: The page component for the old home route
- `styles.module.css`: CSS styling for the old home components
- `layout.tsx`: Layout component with animations and ActionBar integration
- `components/StatusCard.tsx`: Interactive status card component

## Usage

These components can be accessed at `/experiments/old-home` and are not linked from the main navigation. They serve as a historical reference for the previous design of the site.
